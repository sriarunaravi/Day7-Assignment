}
Explanation:
In the myclass class define a static variable "greeting". 
This means the variable is shared by all instances of the MyClass class. 
We can access this variable directly through the class name without needing to create an object.
We define a static method displaygreeting() that prints the value of the "greeting" variable. Since this method is static, it can be called directly from the class without creating an object.
In the "WithoutObject method", we access the static variable "greeting" and the static method  displaygreeting() directly through the class name myclass, without creating an object.
